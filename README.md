##  Tech Stack & Architecture

This project follows the **N-Tier architecture** to ensure scalability and maintainability. Key technologies and patterns used include:

- **ASP.NET MVC** for building the web application  
- **Entity Framework** for ORM and data access  
- **LINQ** for querying data  
- **Unit of Work** and **Generic Repository Pattern** to manage data operations with a clean separation of concerns
- **Token-based Authentication** to securely manage and store user data and access rights

##  Key Features

- **Role-Based Authorization**  
  Control access based on user roles — restrict sensitive actions like adding or deleting records to authorized users only.

- **Secure Authentication**  
  Supports login and registration using **Google** and **Facebook OAuth**, providing a secure and user-friendly experience.

- **Password Recovery System**  
  Includes a “Forgot Password” feature that sends **password reset links via email and Twilio SMS**, ensuring users can recover access easily.
